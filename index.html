          <h2>Technical Distractions</h2>
          <p>
            Install browser extensions or apps that block access to distracting
            websites and apps during study sessions. Examples include
            StayFocusd, Freedom, and Cold Turkey. Disable notifications on
            smartphones, tablets, and computers to minimize interruptions during
            study sessions. Consider using the "Do Not Disturb" mode or airplane
            mode when studying.Incorporate mindfulness techniques, such as deep
            breathing or meditation, to improve focus and concentration. Apps
            like Headspace or Calm can provide guided sessions. Take advantage
            of support services offered by the University, such as academic
            advisors or counseling centers, to receive guidance on time
            management and study strategies. Occasionally disconnect from
            electronic devices and engage in offline activities like exercise,
            hobbies, or socializing to recharge and reduce reliance on
            technology

          <h2>Lack of engagement</h2>
          <p>
            Relate lessons to real-life situations or current events to show
            practical applications. Incorporate topics or activities that align
            with students' interests and passions. Offer students some degree of
            choice in assignments or projects to increase ownership and
            motivation. Assign collaborative projects or activities that require
            teamwork and peer interaction. Encourage students to learn from each
            other through peer tutoring or mentoring. Facilitate meaningful
            discussions where students can share ideas and perspectives.Be
            flexible and willing to adapt instructional strategies based on
            students' needs and feedback. Regularly assess student understanding
            and adjust instruction accordingly.

          <h2>Overcrowded classrooms</h2>
          <p>
            Governments and educational authorities should invest in
            constructing new schools in areas with high student population. Add
            new classrooms or convert unused spaces into classrooms to
            accommodate more students.Increase the number of teachers to reduce
            student-to-teacher ratios. This can be supported by offering
            competitive salaries and benefits. Provide ongoing training for
            teachers to enhance their skills, making them more effective even in
            larger classrooms.Implement policies that set a maximum number of
            students per classroom. Prioritize funding for schools in
            overcrowded areas, ensuring they have the resources needed to manage
            large student populations.Have two or more teachers work together to
            teach larger groups, utilizing their combined strengths and
            providing more support to students.Work with local and national
            governments to secure more funding for educational infrastructure
            and staffing.Encourage parents to support learning at home, reducing
            the pressure on classroom time

          <h2>Language barrier</h2>
          <p>
            Leveraging language learning apps, online resources, and language
            proficiency tests can supplement formal education and provide
            additional practice opportunities outside of the classroom. Faculty
            and staff can support students by clearly outlining communication
            expectations, offering language-friendly resources, and providing
            feedback that helps students improve their language skills. Many
            institutions have dedicated language support centers or labs
            equipped with resources like language learning software, multimedia
            materials, and workshops designed to enhance language proficiency.
            Universities often offer language courses tailored to different
            proficiency levels. Students can enroll in these courses to improve
            their language skills systematically.
